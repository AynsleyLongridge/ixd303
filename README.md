## Oblique Strategies
For the Oblique Strategies I was feeling inspired by Camille Walala. As most people were creating a static background with changing cards I wanted to create a webpage that the background changed aswell as the cards. After a fair while fiddling with the javascript and getting it also to change card 'on click' I created some backgrounds with bold geometric prints and clashing colours.
