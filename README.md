## Safe Surf 
I used Keynote to create the prototype for my Safe Surf app instead of invision, this was because I wanted to try to show more of the interactions I had thought about within the app. However while I went along I have been using InVision's boards as a place for some visual inspiration, this is aswell as a mood board that I always like to start my inital research on pinterest.

## Oblique Strategies
For the Oblique Strategies I was feeling inspired by Camille Walala. As most people were creating a static background with changing cards I wanted to create a webpage that the background changed aswell as the cards. After a fair while fiddling with the javascript and getting it also to change card 'on click' I created some backgrounds with bold geometric prints and clashing colours.
